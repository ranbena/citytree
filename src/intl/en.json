      "As an independent organization at the intersection of environment, health and community, we live and demonstrate what we teach.",
      "Founder Tami Zori began her journey into the urban climate resilience space three decades ago, by following the little things that do good to our health and environment. She established CityTree in 2006 in order to share the accumulating know-how with more people, eventually finding herself  living  her passion within a community. Dr. Alon Eliran has also followed his own personal track of holistic nutrition, urban nature, ecological gardening, foraging, activism and research and joined Tami in 2008, to further create a space for healthy, ecologically-attuned lifestyles and knowledge-sharing."

      "CityTree is a node on the life supporting network called “The Big Movement”. Its friends are active in the Extinction Rebellion and across the environmental movement. The unique present “the Tree” brings to the map is the immediate and accessible possibility for a personal-communal-ecological change. Even for those of us who are active in community gardens, demonstrations or other public activity, there is often a gap between the public and the personal. CityTree turns the home and work in and around it into a subversive, artistic arena of change and discovery and thus complements and enriches any public activity.",
      "At CityTree we live the utopia as much as we can here and now - a utopia sending us hints on every step - from the history of our beloved city to a grasshopper discovered in the garden.",
      "The Tree actively researches how to “live well in the city” and spreads knowhow focused on shaping the urban environment as a space vibrating with life and relationships - amongst people and between them and all living creatures, soil, water and all elements. The valuable information gathered at the Tree may have an existential value at times of crisis, and on the daily basis it simply translates to well being: healthy nutrition, food conservation, returning our organic waste to the soil, working properly with water and plants, human ecology, co-interdependence, circular economy, local productivity."

    "title": "Story of The Tree",
    "text": [
      "In 2006, Tami Zori, an artist who used to be a businesswoman living in New York, built the first “CityTree” website in order to spread the knowledge that was already changing her life - about healthy nutrition, releasing ourselves from reliance on corporations, gardening and compost and about living with respect for the elements and the web of Life.",
      "From a virtual blog space, CityTree evolved with time into a physical space for experiencing and practicing a lifestyle based on the cultivation of soil and plants as well as an ecological household in the urban environment.  Shortly after Tami moved to Bialik Square, in the heart of Tel Aviv, in 2008, CityTree was already ripe to the foundation of the “Ecological Salon”, together with Alon Eliran, today a Doctor of Environmental Sciences, and already back then, an urban forager, gardener and ecological poet. At this point, the house was often full of people and activities and it’s friends began calling it “The Tree.”",
      "Since then, The Tree moved twice more, unbelievably within the tiny Bialik Square. In 2013, seven friends moved together into CityTree’s current residence, at #7, 25 Bialik St., and refounded life at CityTree as one based around communal living. Since then, an exploration of  community became a major theme in CityTree’s work and a growing circle of residents come and go and keep returning, echoing the message: a more beautiful humanity in a more beautiful world is a possible and accessible option. We like to think of CityTree also as a school and even a monastery.",
      "In addition to art and activism in the home and garden, Tami Zori is active  in the art and communications arenas. In 2012, together with Tammy Avihail and a devoted group of partners, Tami performed with an artwork titled “Zero.Home” which envisioned “the end of the world as we know it.” In 2018, an extension of the original piece  “Zero.Home.Soil” was performed on Muslala’s roof on top of the Clal Building in Jerusalem. Through this performance, she suggested a revolutionary treatment technique of the most avoided material - human waste - using unique soil containers she developed together with the soil artist Daphna Yalon.",
      "Increasing awareness of the severity of the climate crisis in 2018 shocked The Tree’s dwellers. In response, Tami and Alon increased their activism and joined Extinction Rebellion, throwing CityTree into an economic crisis. This is how the “Uncomfortable Noah’s Ark” campaign was born, mobilizing  several dozens of people who helped CityTree climb out of the debt. The next crisis came with COVID-19 which birthed the Coming Home online series, which brings us to the present :)",
      "By its essence, The Tree undermines existing economic and social structures and sees its lifestyle as an existential necessity. We refuse to let today’s market rules dictate our range and forms of activity, professional expertise and use “the master's tools” with awareness and caution. Our ideology also contributes to our recurring, at times existential, financial struggles in the current environment. Because our work contributes to the expanding circle of awareness and criticism of the  capitalist system in its current form,and focuses on forming the basis for alternatives, we regularly find ourselves struggling to stay afloat."
